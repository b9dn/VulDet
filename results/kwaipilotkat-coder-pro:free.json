This can cause precision loss and unexpected behavior. The warning threshold should use integer arithmetic instead.2. **Unsafe Input Validation**   - The code checks if `max_total_size_per_batch > 0` but doesn't validate upper bounds for other parameters like `max_size_per_class`, `num_classes`, or `num_boxes`. These could be extremely large values that cause memory exhaustion or denial of service.3. **Missing Bounds Checking for Memory Operations**   - The `ParseAndCheckCombinedNMSBoxSizes()` and `CheckCombinedNMSScoreSizes()` functions are called but their implementations aren't shown. If these functions don't properly validate the computed `num_boxes` and array dimensions, it could lead to buffer overflows.4. **Potential DoS via Large Input Values**   - While there's a warning for large `max_total_size`, the operation still proceeds.

Has no path for code injection, buffer overflows, or other security vulnerabilitiesThe function is read-only and returns only predefined, localized string constants."},{"id":312,"expected":"Safe","received":"Vulnerable"},{"id":56,"expected":"Safe","received":"Vulnerable"},{"id":746,"expected":"Vulnerable","received":"Vulnerable"},{"id":623,"expected":"Vulnerable","received":"Vulnerable"},{"id":763,"expected":"Vulnerable","received":"Vulnerable"},{"id":23,"expected":"Safe","received":"Safe"},{"id":106,"expected":"Safe","received":"Vulnerable"},{"id":726,"expected":"Vulnerable","received":"Vulnerable"},{"id":464,"expected":"Vulnerable","received":"Vulnerable"},{"id":307,"expected":"Safe","received":"Vulnerable"},{"id":348,"expected":"Safe","received":"Vulnerable"},{"id":243,"expected":"Safe","received":"Vulnerable"},{"id":735,"expected":"Vulnerable","received":"Vulnerable"},{"id":97,"expected":"Safe","received":"Safe"},{"id":611,"expected":"Vulnerable","received":"Vulnerable"},{"id":572,"expected":"Vulnerable","received":"Vulnerable"},{"id":349,"expected":"Safe","received":"Safe"},{"id":646,"expected":"Vulnerable","received":"Vulnerable"},{"id":160,"expected":"Safe","received":"Vulnerable"},{"id":256,"expected":"Safe","received":"Vulnerable"},{"id":74,"expected":"Safe","received":"Safe"},{"id":672,"expected":"Vulnerable","received":"Vulnerable"},{"id":2,"expected":"Vulnerable","received":"Vulnerable"},{"id":7,"expected":"Safe","received":"Vulnerable"},{"id":9,"expected":"Safe","received":"Safe"},{"id":12,"expected":"Safe","received":"Safe"},{"id":18,"expected":"Safe","received":"Vulnerable"},{"id":22,"expected":"Safe","received":"Safe"},{"id":24,"expected":"Safe","received":"Safe"},{"id":25,"expected":"Safe","received":"Vulnerable"},{"id":30,"expected":"Safe","received":"Vulnerable"},{"id":32,"expected":"Safe","received":"Safe"},{"id":33,"expected":"Safe","received":"Safe"},{"id":40,"expected":"Safe","received":"Vulnerable"},{"id":41,"expected":"Safe","received":"Vulnerable"},{"id":42,"expected":"Safe","received":"Safe"},{"id":43,"expected":"Safe","received":"Vulnerable"},{"id":44,"expected":"Safe","received":"Safe"},{"id":45,"expected":"Safe","received":"Safe"},{"id":46,"expected":"Safe","received":"Safe"},{"id":48,"expected":"Safe","received":"Vulnerable"},{"id":49,"expected":"Vulnerable","received":"Vulnerable"}]
